# pbrush

Not much to see here. This is just me expermenting with
[Socket.io](http://socket.io) and [Bacon.js](http://baconjs.github.io/).

## Instructions

Run `npm install` to install dependencies, start the server with `node index.js`,
and open your browser to <http://localhost:8080> in two windows to see the
results.

## Todos (in rough order of importance)

1. Add front-end asset compilation (right now dependencies are served from
   CDNs, and the CoffeeScript client is compiled on every request)
2. Remember history, and restore drawing on reconnect
3. Add multiple 'rooms'
4. Add different colors/brushes
5. Add users list
